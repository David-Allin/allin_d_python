# Rock Paper Scissors in Python

### Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: All you need is [Python 3](http://www.Python.org/downloa/releases/3.0) to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the correct directory - <code>cd directory name</code> - and run the game.py file in a Pyhon 3 Termanal window for mac / Linux.

The rules are the same as the classic game:
<ol>

1. Paper covers rock.
2. Scissors cut Paper.
3. Rock smashes Scissors.

</ol>

*Choose your weapon wisely!*

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.

Built with Python 3.
